# INSTATONE

A real time mini basic digital work station. 

When a user logs in, they are able to configure the the type of synth they would like to use from a list of default synths provided. With customizable settings the user can generate a unique sound to their liking. In the tune room the user will have a piano displayed where they will be able to play music with others logged on in real time.
